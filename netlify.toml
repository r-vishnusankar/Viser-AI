# Note: Netlify Functions don't support WebSockets (SocketIO)
# For full Flask app with SocketIO, consider using:
# - Netlify's Python runtime with serverless-http
# - Or deploy to platforms like Railway, Render, or Heroku

# If deploying Flask API endpoints only (without SocketIO):
# 1. Create serverless functions in netlify/functions/
# 2. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
#    Site settings > Environment variables
#    Add all variables from .env.example

# Example redirects for API routes (if using serverless functions)
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/api/*"
#   to = "/.netlify/functions/flask-api"
#   status = 200
#   force = false

# Redirect root to index if you have a static frontend
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/*"
#   to = "/index.html"
#   status = 200
